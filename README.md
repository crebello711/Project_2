# Project_2

For this project, we decided to use Covid-19 vaccine data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations) and Covid-19 case data (https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4).

Below are the steps we followed :

* We extracted data from Kaggle's database of Covid-19 vaccination data, looking at both first and second doses. The data was cleaned by combining Moderna and Pfizer doses, and finding the vaccine doses administered on a state-by-state basis. 

* Next, we took a look at Covid-19 case data, provided by the CDC. We also made sure to clean this dataset by narrowing it down to a state-by-state basis and finding a count of cases in each state. 

* Finally, we combined these two datasets to compare Covid-19 cases in each state with first and second vaccinations from two of the top three providers. 

This final dataset was uploaded into the csv attached.
